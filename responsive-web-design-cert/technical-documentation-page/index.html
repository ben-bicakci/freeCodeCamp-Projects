                <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>
                <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p>
                <p>Some examples:</p>
                <div class="code-display">
                    <pre>
                        <code class="python">
    # this is the first comment
    spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
    # ... and now a third!
    >text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                <header>Numbers</header>
                <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>
                <div class="code-display">
                    <pre>
                        <code class="python">
    >>>> 2 + 2
    4
    >>> 50 - 5*6
    20
    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
    5.0<
    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floatpoint number
    1.6
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.</p>

                <header>Strings</header>
                <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
                <div class="code-display">
                    <pre>
                        <code class="python">
    >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
    'spam eggs'
    >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
    "doesn't"
    >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
    "doesn't"
    >>> '"Yes," they said.'
    '"Yes," they said.'
    >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
    '"Yes," they said.'
    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
    '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:</p>
                <div class="code-display">
                    <pre>
                        <code class="python">
    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
    '"Isn\'t," they said.'
    >>> print('"Isn\'t," they said.')
    "Isn't," they said.
    >>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newlinede
    >>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
    'First line.\nSecond line.'
    >>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
    First line.
    Second line.
                        </code>

                <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>
                <div class="code-display">
                        <pre>
                            <code class="python">
    >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    >>> squares
    >>> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>
                <div class="code-display">
                        <pre>
                            <code class="python">
    >>>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the itee
    >1
    >>>> squares [-1]
    >25
    >>>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new lise
    >[9, 16, 25]
                            </code>

                <header>First Steps Towards Programming</header>
                <p>Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:</p>
                <div class="code-display">
                        <pre>
                            <code class="python">
    >>> # Fibonacci series:
    ... # the sum of two elements defines the next
    ... a, b = 0, 1
    >>> while a < 10:
    ...     print(a)
    ...     a, b = b, a+b
    ...e>
    0
    1
    1
    2
    3
    5
    8
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                <p>This example introduces several new features:</p>
                <li>The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.</li>
                <li>The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to) and != (not equal to).
                </li>
                <li>The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility.</li>
                <li>When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.</li>
                <li>The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs from just writing the expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments, floating point quantities, and strings.</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="if_Statements">
                <header>if Statements</header>
                <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
                <div class="python-code">
                    <pre class="python">
                        <code>
    >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
    Please enter an integer: 42
    >>> if x < 0:
    ...     x = 0
    ...     print('Negative changed to zero')
    ... elif x == 0:
    ...     print('Zero')
    ... elif x == 1:
    ...     print('Single')
    ... else:
    ...     print('More')
    ...
    More
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="for_Statements">
                <header>for Statements</header>
                <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>
                <div class="python-code">
                    <pre class="python">
                        <code>
    >>> # Measure some strings:
    ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
    >>> for w in words:
    ...     print(w, len(w))
    ...
    cat 3
    window 6
    defenestrate 12
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended that you first make a copy. Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:</p>
                <div class="python-code">
                    <pre class="python">
                        <code>
    >>> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice the entire list.
    ...     if len(w) > 6:
    ...         words.insert(0, w)
    ...
    >>> words
    ['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>With for w in words:, the example would attempt to create an infinite list, inserting defenestrate over and over again.</p>
